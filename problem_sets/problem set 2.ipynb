    "#### Exercise 1: Fixed-point iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we will find the roots of the function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(α, x) = x^3 - \\alpha x + \\sqrt{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "by using fixed-point iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a Julia function for $f$ and draw it; make an interactive\n",
    " visualization as $\\alpha$ changes.\n",
    "    [Make sure to fix the plot limits so as to be able to see\n",
    "    what's going on.]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When $\\alpha$ varies, the number of real roots can change.\n",
    "    For which approximate value of $\\alpha$ does the number of real roots change?\n",
    "    How many real roots are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When $\\alpha = 2.5$, approximately where are the roots? From now on fix $\\alpha$\n",
    "    to this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest thing we can try is $g(x) = x + f(α, x)$, since then a\n",
    "    fixed point of $g$ is a root of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plot the function $g(x)$ and the function $y=x$. Taking into account the results stated in the slides,\n",
    "    which root do you expect to be able to calculate by iterating $g$? Fix an initial\n",
    "    condition and show that it does converge there.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the rate of convergence to that root?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens with the initial condition $x=1.1$? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Draw a [cobweb diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobweb_plot) to illustrate this\n",
    "    behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. By using algebraic transformations, find fixed-point iterations $g$ that\n",
    "    converge to the other two roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are two alternative approaches\n",
    "    you can take here.\n",
    "    The first is to find other iteration schemes,\n",
    "    $x = h(x)$ by algebraically rearranging $f(\\alpha, x) = 0$ to isolate\n",
    "    an $x$ on one side.\n",
    "    The second is to introduce the generalized\n",
    "    function $g(c, x) := x + c f(x)$.\n",
    "    Make an interactive plot of $g(c,x)$ and $y = x$ as $c$ varies.\n",
    "    What do you notice about the slope of $g(c, x)$ at the\n",
    "    fixed points as $c$ changes? Can you use\n",
    "    this to change the stabilities of the fixed points in the iteration scheme?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. (**Extra credit**) Call $\\alpha_c$ the **critical value** of $\\alpha$ at which the number of roots\n",
    "    changes. [This is called a **bifurcation point**.] Find $\\alpha_c$ numerically."

    "#### Exercise 2: Defining a type for Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have already used polynomials, we haven't had a way\n",
    "to say \"this object is a polynomial\". For this we need to **define a new type**!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a type `Polynomial` to represent a polynomial. It should\n",
    "    have fields `degree` and `coefficients`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a **constructor** function with the same name (`Polynomial`)\n",
    "    that accepts a vector of coefficients and builds a `Polynomial`\n",
    "    object whose degree it automatically calculates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a `show` method to display the polynomial nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a function to evaluate the polynomial at a point `x`, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```julia\n",
    "    function (p::Polynomial)(x)\n",
    "        # fill in\n",
    "    end\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then if you have an object `p` of type polynomial, writing e.g. `p(3)`\n",
    "    will evaluate that polynomial at the value 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a function `derivative` that takes a polynomial and returns a new polynomial\n",
    "    that is its derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Julia contains a module `Test` (in the standard library -- no installation\n",
    "    required) for testing that code is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write a few tests of the functionality you have defined using\n",
    "    tests of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```julia\n",
    "    @test a == b\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    E.g. to test the sum of two `Polynomial`s you can write\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```julia\n",
    "    @test Polynomial([1, 2]) + Polynomial([3, 4]) == Polynomial([4, 6])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you run these tests, you should see the message `Test passed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To create the tests, do the calculations by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3: Newton method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `newton` to implement the Newton method. It should\n",
    "    take a function $f$, its derivative $f\\prime$ and an initial guess $x_0$.\n",
    "    It should terminate when the residual is less than some tolerance, or when\n",
    "    the number of iterations is too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a specialised method of `newton` for polynomials that accepts\n",
    "    an object of type `Polynomial`, written `p::Polynomial` and calculates its\n",
    "    derivative automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Taking the same polynomial as in exercise 1,\n",
    "    confirm that the Newton method has quadratic convergence by\n",
    "    verifying numerically the defining limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can you find different roots by taking different initial conditions\n",
    "    $x_0$? How will you know if/when you have found all of the roots like this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton method works fantastically well when the starting point is close enough to a root,\n",
    "    but can also behave very badly, as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many roots does the function $f(z) = z^3 - 1$ have in the complex plane\n",
    "    $\\mathbb{C}$? Where are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate those roots using the Newton method with *complex* starting points $a + ib$\n",
    "    forming a square grid in the complex plane. Store the imaginary part of the resulting root\n",
    "    (or final value, if no root is reached) in a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Plot the matrix with the `heatmap` function and plot the true roots as\n",
    "points. What kind of object are you seeing? What does this imply for the Newton method?\n",
    "    What happens close to the roots?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4: Aberth method\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method only finds one root at a time. The [Aberth method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberth_method)\n",
    "  calculates them all at once! Given estimates $(z_k)$ for all roots of a polynomial it calculates\n",
    "  a new estimate via $z_k = z_k - w_k$, where\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$w_{k}={\\frac{\\frac{p(z_{k})}{p'(z_{k})}}{1-{\\frac{p(z_{k})}{p'(z_{k})}}\\cdot \\sum_{j\\neq k}{\\frac {1}{z_{k}-z_{j}}}}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  In order to guarantee convergence the initial guess must be chosen in a special way. Cauchy's bound tells us that all\n",
    "  the roots of a polynomial $p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\cdots + a_n x^n$ must have absolute value less than\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$U = 1+\\max \\left( \\left \\lvert \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}} \\right\\rvert,\\left\\lvert \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n}} \\right\\rvert,\\ldots ,\\left\\lvert \\frac{a_{0}}{a_{n}}\\right\\rvert \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  and a lower bound of\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$L = \\frac{1}{1+\\max \\left\\{ \\left \\lvert \\frac{a_{n}}{a_{0}} \\right\\rvert,\\left\\lvert \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{0}} \\right\\rvert,\\ldots ,\\left\\lvert \\frac{a_{1}}{a_{0}}\\right\\rvert \\right\\} }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  The starting points should be chosen so that their absolute value lies in between these bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a function `poly_bounds` that takes in a `Polynomial` and returns $L$ and $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `poly_bounds` to write a function `initialize_points` that finds a suitable starting group of points. Do this\n",
    "    by choosing $\\rho$s sampled from a uniform distribution over $[L, U]$ and $\\theta$s sampled from a uniform\n",
    "    distribution over $[0, 2\\pi]$. Then calculate $z = \\rho e^{i\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Hint: The `rand()` function generates uniform\n",
    "    random numbers between $0$ and $1$. Use `rand` to write a function `uniform(a, b)` to generate uniform numbers between\n",
    "    $a$ and $b$.]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement the Aberth method for a polynomial $p$ which takes in values\n",
    "from `initialize_points` and terminates either after a certain\n",
    "number of iterations or when a certain tolerance is met.\n",
    "Test your function for the polynomials we have considered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make an interactive visualization of the progress over time on some random\n",
    "    polynomials of degree 10 or 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Find numerically the order of convergence of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Try polynomials with multiple roots, such as $(x^2 + 1)^3$. What happens?"
