Suppose that we perturb the input, $h$, by $\\Delta h$. Calculate (analytically) an approximation to the (absolute) error $\\Delta g$ on the output to first order in $\\Delta h$; you should find that it grows like $h^{-1}$.\n\n2. Suppose that the input perturbation size is $\\epsilon_\\text{mach}$; the error from [1] is then the **roundoff error**. Find an estimate for the value of $h$ at which the truncation error balances with the roundoff error, and find the size of the error there. Compare this with the plot that we did in class.\n\n3. Consider an interval $[a, b]$ and let $m$ be the midpoint of the interval.\nUse Lagrange interpolation to find an analytical expression for the unique\nquadratic function that passes through $(a, f(a))$, $(m, f(m))$ and $(b, f(b))$.\n\n4. Use your result from [3] to derive the centered difference approximation for\nthe derivative $f'(t_k)$ in terms of equally-spaced points $t_k$ separated by\na distance $h$.\n\n5. What approximation does it give for the second derivative $f''(t_k)$?\n\n6. Use [3] to find a backward difference expression for $f'(t_k)$ using\ninformation at nodes $t_{k-2}$ and $t_{k-1}$.\n\n7. Find numerically the rate of convergence of the results from [3] and [4] for\nequally-spaced points separated by a distance $h$ for the function $\\sin(2x)$ at $x = \\pi/4$, for values of $h$ between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-1}$.\n\n### Exercise 2: Integration using Simpson's rule\n\nIn this problem we will derive the second-order Newton--Cotes quadrature rule, known as **Simpson’s rule**, for calculating $\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx$.\n\nSuppose you are given an $N$-point quadrature rule with nodes $(t_k)_{k=0^N}$ and weights $(w_k)_{k=0}^N$ for integrating over the interval $[-1, 1]. That is, the $t_k$  are $N+1$ points with $-1 \\le t_k \\le 1$, and the $w_k$ are given to you such that\n\n$$\\int_{-1}^1 f(x) \\, dx \\simeq \\sum_{k=0}^N w_k \\, f(t_k)$$\n\n1. Construct a new quadrature rule for integrating over a\ngeneral interval $[u, v]$. I.e., find $t_k'$ and $w_k'$ such that\n\n    $$\\int_{u}^v f(x) \\, dx \\simeq \\sum_{k=0}^N w_k' f(t_k')$$\n\n\nDerive the basic\\footnote{Basic quadrature rules are for nodes distributed over a single interval; composite quadrature rules are obtained by splitting up a large interval into subintervals and using a basic rule on each subinterval.} second-order Newton--Cotes quadrature rule for\n$\\int_{-1}^1 f(x) \\, dx$, as follows:\n\n2. Use your results from [Exercise 1] to find the degree-2 polynomial $p_2$ that agrees with $f$ at the three points $x=-1, 0, 1$. (Leave your result in terms of the values $f(-1)$, $f(0)$ and $f(1)$.)\n\n3. Integrate $p_2$ interval $[-1, 1]$ to approximate $\\int f$ in terms of $f(-1$, $f(0)$ and $f(1)$. Express this result as a quadrature rule.\n\n4. Combine your answers to [2] and [3] to write down the basic (not composite) Simpson’s rule for integrating f over $[u, v]$.\n\n5. Given an interval $[a, b]$, subdivide it into $N$ equal-width subintervals, apply the basic Simpson’s rule to integrate $f$ over each subinterval, and sum the results to obtain the composite Simpson rule for integrating $f$ over $[a, b]$. How many samples of f does this rule require? (Be careful not to overcount).\n\n#### Exercise 3: Using Newton--Cotes methods\n\n1. Implement the composite 0th (rectangle), 1st (trapezoid), and 2nd-order (Simpson) Newton--Cotes quadrature rules for integrating an arbitrary function over an arbitrary interval with $N + 1$ points. Each should be a single function like `rectangle(f, a, b, N)`.\n\n    Note that in the case of Simpson's rule, we are using a *total* of $N+1$ points; how many intervals does this correspond to?\n\n2. Calculate $\\int_{-1}^1 \\exp(2x) \\, dx$ using each method. Plot the relative error\n\n$$E(N) := \\frac{I_\\text{approx}(N) - I_\\text{exact}}{I_\\text{exact}}$$\n\n as a function of $N$ for $N$ in the range $[10, 10^6]$ (or use a higher or lower upper bound depending on the computing power you have available).\n\n Do these errors correspond with the expectations from the arguments in lectures?\n\n3. Do the same for $\\int_{-1}^2 \\exp(-x^2) \\, dx$. Use the `erf` function from the `SpecialFunctions.jl` package to calculate the \"exact\" result. [Hint: Check carefully the help for that function to make sure of the definition used.]\n\n4. We showed that the trapezium rule has error at most $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. Consider the following integral of a smooth, periodic function:\n\n    $$I = \\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} \\exp(\\cos(\\theta)) \\, d\\theta$$\n\n    Plot the error in the trapezium rule in this case. How fast does it decay with $N$? [This will be important later in the course.]\n\n    Note that this integral can be calculated exactly as $2π I_0(1)$, where $I_0$ is a **modified Bessel function**, which can be evaluated at 1 using the `SpecialFunctions.jl` package as `besseli(0, 1)`.\n\n\n#### Exercise 4: Euler method for ODEs\n\n1. Implement the Euler method in a function `euler(f, x0, δt, t_final)`, assuming that $t_0 = 0$. Your code should work equally well if you put vectors in, to solve the equation $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n\n2. Use your code to integrate the differential equation $\\dot{x} = 2x$ from $t = 0$ to $t = 5$ with\ninitial condition $x_0 = 0.5$. Plot the exact solution and the numerical solution for values of $\\delta t = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5$. On a different plot show the relative error as a function of time, compared to the analytical solution.\n\n3. Do the same for $\\dot{x} = -2x$ with initial condition $x_0 = 3$.\n\n4. For the above two cases, calculate the error at $t=5$ when the time interval is split into $N$ pieces for $N between 10 and 1000$. Plot the error as a function of $N$. What is the rate of convergence as $h \\to 0$?\n\n\nA pendulum satisfies the ODE $\\ddot{\\theta} + \\sin(\\theta) = 0$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the vertical.\n\n5. Show analytically that the quantity (\"energy\") $E(\\theta, \\dot{\\theta}) := \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{\\theta}^2 - \\cos(\\theta)$ is **conserved** along a trajectory, i.e. that $\\frac{d}{dt} [ E(\\theta(t), \\dot{\\theta}(t)) = 0 ]$, so that $E(\\theta(t), \\dot{\\theta}(t)) = E(\\theta(t_0), \\dot{\\theta}(t_0))$.\n\n6. Solve this equation using the Euler method for initial conditions $(0, 1)$ to show that the energy is *not* conserved.\n\n7. Draw the phase plane. Explain graphically what is happening in terms of what each step does.\n\n8. Plot $E$ as a function of time for different values of $\\delta t$. How fast does it grow? Explain this in terms of what happens at each step."
